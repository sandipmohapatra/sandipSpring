Waterfall Model :-
--------------------------------------------
1)Requirements
2)system design
3)implementation
4)Integration and testing
5)Deployment of system(client system)
6)Maintenance
This process goes on for a long time .The feedback from the customer also comes after a long time.It may happen that the demand for the product may go done.

Agile Model:-
The design,development ,testing and releases are done frequently.the feedback is also received from the customer fequently.The demand of the product will not go down as frequently the  versions  are released.  

Agile and Scrum
------------------------------
Agile encourages that a little of every thing ,include design ,development,and testing is done at the same time.
The traditional approach to projects closes and completes one phase before the next begins.
Agile encourages short,frequent feedback loops and encourages changes to requirements.


In waterfall model the feedback is usually not collected until the end. 

Scrum is a framework of Agile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)It is lightweight
2)Simple to understand
3)Difficult to master.

It is a framework within which people can address complex problems.
This is to make the team productive ,creative and ready to deliver on time.
It require team collaboration to meet the end points.

The roles of scrum team
-------------------------------------
It consists of a Product owner,the development team and a scrum master.
The scrum are self-organized and cross functional.
The self organized is needed to see how best to accomplish there work.
The cross functional because the team can do any task without depending on other.

The scrum team is designed to optimize flexibility,creativity and productivity.

The scrum events are
------------------------------------
1)sprint(module)
2)sprint planning
3)daily Scrum
4)Sprint Review
  

Scrum is just one of the many iterative and incremental agile software development method. 

In the SCRUM methodology a sprint is the basic unit of development. 

Each sprint starts with a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made. 

A Sprint ends with a review  meeting where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. 
During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product.

In the Agile methods each iteration involves a team working through a full software development cycle, including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders.

So if in a SCRUM sprint you perform all the software development phases (from requirement analysis to acceptance testing), and in my opinion you should, you can say SCRUM sprints correspond to AGILE iterations.
